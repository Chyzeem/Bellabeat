Data Source
The data source is the Fitbit Fitness Tracker by Mobius. The original structure of data is long data.

About the Data Dataset Limitation
The dataset used is the Fitbit Fitness Tracker by Mobius, retrieved from Kaggle. The sample size of 33 smart device users may not represent the behavior of the population
of smart device users. It only means the minimum sample size to obtain statistical significance. In addition, critical data tables such as; heart rate value, Body mass index
(BMI), Fat, and weight contain multiple missing data. These limitations may or may not affect the integrity of the analysis results.

Dataset Cleaning and Manipulation
The first step in cleaning the dataset is to explore it using Excel. The dataset has most of its tables in long data format and a few in wide data format. Taking into
consideration the business task for descriptive analysis, the goal is to reveal patterns. To do this, the tables need to be merged to simplify the scope of work.
* The tool selected for further manipulation is Tableau, as it provides a multi-faceted interface to obtain insights from the dataset.
* Once in Tableau, the dataset is uploaded. The following next steps are taken.;
* The uploaded dataset tables are joined using the right join command.
* The next step is to check that data types are correctly placed.
* Extraction of the data source uploaded is done to ensure new joined dataset is intact and ready for manipulation. (NB: Tableau desktop may not be able to load larger files,
Tableau Public is preferred if individual CSV files are above 10MB).
* The next step is to change column names to suit the theme of analysis in order to have clear, readable, and easy-to-understand visuals. Moving forward with creating the frame for visuals, some calculated fields were added to aid the analysis. Some of these are; Variances between tracked distance and actual
total distance, the Sum of Partially active minutes, and the Sum of Partially active distance.
Finally, the sheets are named in line with the theme.
At this point, visual formatting is commenced.
The distribution of the sheets can be seen in the dashboard below.
